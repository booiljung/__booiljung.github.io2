    <p>In today’s rapidly changing environment, organizations are evolving faster than ever. For an organization to continue growing and succeeding amidst such changes, the clear definition and management of roles and responsibilities are essential. The efficiency, performance, and competitiveness of an organization are determined by how well the roles and responsibilities of its members are defined and managed.</p>
<p>This book is designed to provide a systematic understanding of roles and responsibilities within organizations. Many organizations face challenges related to role distribution, the principles of assigning responsibility, and redefining roles in response to changing environments. However, in-depth discussions on these critical issues are often lacking. This book addresses these core organizational topics and aims to offer both practical and theoretical insights through various cases and theories.</p>
<p>The primary audience of this book is readers with a foundational understanding of organizational theory, and its focus is on providing a deeper understanding of roles and responsibilities within organizations. Covering topics such as the definition and importance of roles, criteria for role distribution, the balance of responsibility, and performance evaluation of roles and responsibilities, this book offers clear guidelines on how to define and manage roles and responsibilities within an organization.</p>
<p>Additionally, this book discusses how roles and responsibilities must evolve and develop in the face of a changing organizational environment. It addresses the future of organizational structures, the impact of AI and automation, and the various challenges and opportunities organizations will face in the future, offering strategies to respond to these changes.</p>
<p>Through this book, readers will gain a clearer understanding of their roles and responsibilities within their organizations and be better equipped to contribute to the growth and development of their organizations. Emphasizing once again that the clear definition and management of roles and responsibilities are critical to an organization’s success, I hope this book serves as a valuable reference for those navigating the complexities of roles and responsibilities within their organizations.</p>
